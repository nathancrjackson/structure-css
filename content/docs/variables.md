A quick run down of the variable files

## _index.scss

This just forwards the other files

## _options.scss

If you want to exclude files (i.e. flex.scss or grid.scss) from Structure.CSS you can do so here

## _units.scss

This file has the `x1unit` base in it and all the breakpoint variables

## _colors.scss

Here are the standard colours

## _fonts.scss

Font familys and line heights live here.

## _layout.scss

If you don't like a base elements margin, padding and in some cases width you can adjust them here.
