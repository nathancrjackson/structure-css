# Structure.CSS
_Because sometimes you just need a little bit of Structure_

Structure.CSS is a very simple framework for very simple websites. I wrote this for my own enjoyment and experience. I don't really expect anyone else to use it. Honestly it's probably for the best that they don't as this project lacks maturity.

This repo doubles as the hugo site I use to adjust Structure.CSS, if you want a bare bones theme you can commandeer a copy of this one (the repo is MIT license).

If you are looking for something like this that is a little more polished [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/) appears to be a pretty good choice.

For a framework that has all the bells and whistles, shout out to [Foundation](https://get.foundation/index.html) which is what I've used in the past.

## Demo
I'm currently hosting a copy of the demo.html site here: [https://njit.io/projects/structure-css/](https://njit.io/projects/structure-css/)

## Features
- Written in SCSS for easier tweakability
- Supports browser dark mode
- ...is being basic a feature?
