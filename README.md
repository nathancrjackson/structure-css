# Structure.CSS

_Because sometimes you just need a little bit of Structure_

Structure.CSS is a very basic framework for simple websites. I wrote this for my own enjoyment and experience. I don't expect anyone else to use it, honestly it's probably for the best that they don't. If you are looking for something like this that is a little more polished [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/) appears to be a pretty good choice. For a framework that has all the bells and whistles [Foundation](https://get.foundation/index.html) is what I've used in the past.

## Demo

I'm currently hosting a copy of the demo.html site here: [https://njit.io/demo/structure-css/](https://njit.io/demo/structure-css/)

## Features
- Written in SCSS for easier tweakability
- Supports browser dark mode
- ...is being basic a feature?
